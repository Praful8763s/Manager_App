# üß© Patching applications

The following pages will guide you through using ReVanced Manager to patch applications.

## ü™ú Steps to patch applications

1. Navigate to the **Patcher** tab from the bottom navigation bar
2. Tap on the **Select an application** card
3. Choose an application to patch[^1]
   > **Note**: The application version suggested by ReVanced Manager is visible in each application's card. This is important in step 5. below, as most patches are compatible with this version.
4. Tap on the **Select patches** card and select the patches you want to apply[^2]
   > **Warning**: If you see a warning icon next to a patch, it means that the patch is not compatible with the application version you selected in step 3. above. In this case, you should either go back and select a different application version or deselect the patch.
5. Tap on the **Done** button to confirm your selection
6. Tap on the **Patch** button to start patching
   > **Warning**: The patching process can take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes depending on your device. Refrain from exiting ReVanced Manager while the process is still running, otherwise the patching time will increase significantly.
7. After patching is complete, tap on the **Install** button to install the patched application
   > **Note**: If you have root access on your device, you may have the option to mount the patched application on top of the original application.[^4]
   
   > **Note**: Optionally, you may tap on the three vertical dots in the top right to export the patched application to storage

[^1]: You may be prompted to select an application from storage in case you have no root access on your device. In this case, select the APK file from your device storage[^3].
[^2]: It is suggested to use the default set of patches by tapping on the **Default** chip above the list of patches.
[^3]: You can obtain `.apk` files from sites such as [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/).
[^4]: Mounting the patched application on top of the original application will only work if the installed application version matches the version of the application selected in step 3. above.
