The following pages will guide you through using ReVanced Manager to patch apps.

## ‚úÖ Steps to patch apps

1. Navigate to the Apps tab from the top navigation bar
2. Tap the + button in the bottom right corner
3. Choose an app to patch[^1]
4. Tap on the version of the app you want to patch[^2]
5. Select the patches you want to apply
6. Tap the Patch button
7. Tap on the **Install** button
   > **Note**: If you are rooted, you can mount the patched app on top of the original app.[^3]
   > Optionally, you may export the patched app to storage using the options in the top right corner.

[^1]: Non-root users may be prompted to select an APK from storage, in which case you have to source the APK file yourself. ReVanced does not provide any APK files.
[^2]: It is suggested to use the version with the most patches to get the most out of ReVanced.
[^3]: Mounting the patched app on top of the original app will only work if the installed app version matches the version of the app selected in step 4. above.
